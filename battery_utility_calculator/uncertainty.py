"""Parametric scenario generation for the uncertainty analysis.

The optimizer is deterministic and has perfect foresight. To say something about
how uncertain a storage worth is, the same problem is solved once per sampled
scenario and the resulting spread is evaluated (wait-and-see).

Scenarios are drawn from the deterministic base timeseries by adding correlated
noise. Two properties matter for the result and are therefore explicit:

* Cross correlation. Retail prices follow the exchange, PV weighs on it, and the
  community market reacts mostly to local PV feed-in. Sampling the series
  independently would create combinations that do not occur and would misstate
  the storage worth. See ``DEFAULT_CORRELATIONS`` for the assumed structure.
* Persistence. Forecast errors last - a cloudy day stays cloudy. Independent
  noise per timestep would average out over the horizon and understate the
  spread of the storage worth considerably.

#
# Reasoning behind the values:
#
# * Retail prices track the exchange one to one, so their disturbance is the same
#   disturbance. As a consequence supplier_prices is not free to have its own
#   relationship with anything else - it inherits every correlation of
#   wholesale_market_prices. The two supplier entries below are therefore not
#   independent choices, they are copies of the wholesale row, and changing one
#   without the other makes the matrix unsamplable.
# * PV weighs on the exchange price, but only weakly: wind can depress prices just
#   as well on an overcast day, so a low price is a poor indicator of sunshine.
# * The community market is driven by local PV feed-in rather than by the
#   exchange - hence nearly independent of wholesale, but clearly negative
#   against solar_generation.
#
# Note that a single common market factor cannot produce this structure: tying
# supplier to wholesale at 1.0 would force correlation(solar, community) to be
# the product of their wholesale correlations, about -0.02 instead of -0.50. The
# matrix is therefore given directly and checked in build_correlation_matrix.
