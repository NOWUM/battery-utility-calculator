"""Shared validation of the timeseries indices.

All inputs of the optimizer have to sit on the same time axis. Checking that
with ``Index.equals`` compares the dtype as well, so the same instants stored at
different datetime resolutions - ``datetime64[ns]`` against ``datetime64[us]``,
which is what you get when one series comes from ``pd.date_range`` and another
from a file or a database - are reported as different on pandas 2.x. Comparing
the values instead keeps the check on what actually matters.
